## Project Description
We choose to build a risk game because it is a game we like and it reminds us a lot of fun with friends and family.

## Rules
The world is yours to take. Dispatch your army on your territories and organize yourself wisely to conquer a maximum of territories.

The combat rules are based on dice rolls. Each best dices are compared and the loser loses a soldier in the country under attack. When he doesn't have any more soldiers, the territory is lost to the attacker.

## Workflow
1. Write the pseudo-code and split the workload between us
2. Etienne coded the board with classes and functions
3. Geoffroy coded the main function: the attack / dice roll
4. Merging our two codes, fixing errors and testing every outcome

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
We didn't use trello or kanban board, we have just spoke together and split the workload between us

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
We both fork our repository and add the only file which contain the code to our repository
