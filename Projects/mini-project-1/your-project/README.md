## Project Description
I choose to build a risk game because it's game that I used to play when I was young with my cousins. It reminds me
lots of amazing plays.

## Rules
Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players.
The goal of the game is to conquer the world by occupying all territories on the board.
Every player has an army in order to conquer territory.

## Workflow
1. We pseudo code the project and split the task between us
2. Etienne created the class for the players and the continent. He also created some functions.
3. I created the main function which corresponds to the attack function
4. We tested every single options of our codes to identify errors


## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?
We didn't use trello or kanban board, we have just spoke together and split the tasks between us

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
We both fork our repository and add the only file which contain the code to our repository
